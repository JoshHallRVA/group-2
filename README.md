<h2>Technologies used</h2>

<strong>HTML/CSS/Javascript</strong> - HypeBeast was built using these core technologies. Both hand-crafted code and robust libraries were used to create the features necessary to give HypeBeast a modern style, with an easy-to-use experience.  

<strong>Bootstrap</strong> - The elegant style and feel of HypeBeast incorporates several of the styling tools pioneered and perfected by Bootstrap. 

<strong>jQuery</strong> - Much of the smooth interactivity of HypeBeast is put into motion with jQuery.  Moving information to and from relational databases is made much smoother with the use of jQuery.    

<strong>AJAX</strong> - Piggybacking off of jQuery, AJAX is invaluable to communicating with the hand-tailored HypeBeast API.

<strong>JSON</strong> - Communication between servers, relational databases, and front-end rendering relies heavily on the constructing and parsing of JSON objects.  

<strong>Heroku</strong> - HypeBeast is now accessible from anywhere in the universe that has access to the world wide web thanks to the Heroku cloud platform and their willingness to aid developers by allowing for free and easy app deployment.

<strong>clearDb</strong> - All the data needed to deliver the experience to the HypeBeast is housed inside of clearDb.

<strong>MySQL</strong> - All data creation and manipulation takes place using the MySQL dialect. 

<strong>Sequelize</strong> - Connections, data handling and delivery, and database management is handled using the Sequelize library. 

<strong>Node</strong> - Servers were built on the Node.js platform. Using an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript run-time environment allowed us to customize many available libraries to suit Garage Sailor.

<strong>Express</strong> - Express was chosen for its fast, unopinionated, and minimalist qualities as our web framework for HypeBeast.

<strong>Git</strong> - As with all projects, Git remains invaluable to the creation, development, communication, and support of HypeBeast.

<strong>What's in store for Hypebeast in the near future?</strong>

As we continue to become "The Sneakerhead Headquarters", we will collaborate with the hottest vendors in the footwear industry to bring our Beasts the lastest and greatest arrivals by adding retail to our site for that one stop shop experience. This will allow Beasts to buy rare finds and the new releases while creating frienships with fellow Hypebeast! 

To bring more awareness to the brand we will hosts  Sneaker Conferences by taking the conference on tour to major cities and countries. As we locate the best buyers and traders around the world, we will set up offices in other countries to create a global brand!
